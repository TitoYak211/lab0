#Code-254
Code-254 is an idea for a free intensive one week summer program in Nairobi, Kenya intended to introduce high schoolers to programming and algorithms.

In this project, there are 3 html files: index; the main page, the syllabus, and the sign-up form. THere is one background image of the author(Tito Yak) teaching grade 8 students. There are 2 stylesheets: code-254.css and grid.css
